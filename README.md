# NHL-Model-2020-2021-Season

A predictive model for the 2020-2021 NHL Season. My first attempt at predicting the outcomes of hockey games and comparing against available odds in the market. 
Using 10 day rolling stats to supplement the linear regression, and predicted expected goals scored and allowed. 
Finally using a poission distribution to calculate win percentage and measure against bookmakers implied win percentage. 
The limitations of this code are lack of automation in pulling rolling datasets in, daily odds, and some buggy excel buttons. 
This model is built entirely in excel, any questions please feel free to email Kpsheahe@syr.edu.
